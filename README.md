# Credit analytics of student loan for early risk score prediction

## Problem Statement

Two data files are provided:
1. "Origination Data.csv" provides characteristics of student loans that have been originated.
2. The second file, "Performance.xlsx", is a performance summary of loans. The "Early Risk Score" is an indicator of poor credit performance (the higher the score, the riskier the loan).

Review the two files and analyze the data to determine if there are any loan characteristics (in the Origination Data file) that are predictive of the Early Risk Score.
